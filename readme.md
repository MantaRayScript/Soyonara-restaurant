# Soyonara restaurant project

Hello everyone! :wave: This is my first repository for GitHub (please don't eat me).

## About The Project

This is a project of a fictional japanese sushi restaurant located in Berlin (Germany). I did it for the challenge from SheCodes but unfortunately I did not have enough time to upload this project for the contest. Nevertheless I decided to continue the project on my own time.\
The project is still in progress and I would like to fix a few styling issues before I start learning JavaScript and implement JS into the project.\
Right now I consider myself as a beginner who knows a bit html and css but not JS (at least not for coding on my own:sweat_smile:).\
I will keep updating this file while working on the project.

## Contributing

If you found a mistake that should be fixed, please let me know. I'm still learning and I'm aware that I might have them here. :sweat_smile:

## Roadmap
